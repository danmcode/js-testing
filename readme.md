# ðŸ§ª Software Testing Concepts (Explained Simply)

## ðŸ”¹ Core Concepts

-   **SUT (System Under Test)** â†’ The piece of software you are testing.
    (Like the main actor in your test movie.)
-   **Validation** ("Are we building the system correctly?") â†’ Checks if
    the system works as intended, technically correct.
-   **Verification** ("Are we building the system we need?") â†’ Checks if
    the system solves the real problem for the user.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ Test Methodologies

-   **TDD (Test Driven Development)** â†’ Write tests **before** writing
    the code. Helps guide design and avoid bugs.
-   **BDD (Behavior Driven Development)** â†’ Write tests in a way that
    describes **behavior** in natural language (close to how users
    think).
-   **AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert)** â†’ A common test structure:
    -   Arrange = prepare the scenario
    -   Act = do the action
    -   Assert = check the result

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ Test Results

-   **False Positive** â†’ Test says "everything is fine" when it's
    **not** fine. (Bad, dangerous.)
-   **False Negative** â†’ Test says "something is wrong" when it's
    actually **fine**. (Annoying, wastes time.)
-   **Coverage** â†’ How much of your code is touched by tests (e.g., 80%
    coverage = 80% of lines executed in tests).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ Test Doubles (fakes used in tests instead of real things)

-   **Dummy** â†’ Fake data used just to fill information (not actually
    used).
-   **Fake** â†’ A lightweight implementation of something, good enough
    for testing (like a fake user or fake database).
-   **Stub** â†’ Fake object that returns pre-defined data (like a canned
    API response).
-   **Spy** â†’ Records how a dependency was used (e.g., "function X was
    called 2 times").
-   **Mock** â†’ Like a stub + spy combined: pre-programmed with expected
    responses and also records usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ Types of Tests

-   **Unit Tests** â†’ Test small pieces (a function, a class, a method).
    They are **isolated** (don't touch database, network, etc.).
-   **Integration Tests** â†’ Test multiple pieces working together (e.g.,
    function + database).
-   **Functional Tests** â†’ Test **user flows** (e.g., "login â†’ add to
    cart â†’ checkout").
-   **E2E (End-to-End) Tests** â†’ Test like a real user: from start to
    finish, simulating clicks, typing, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”¹ Extra Notes

-   **What is a Unit?** â†’ The smallest testable part of your code (like
    one Lego block).
-   **Test Double** â†’ Generic term for mocks, spies, stubs, fakes,
    dummies.

## Example command

`npm test -- --coverage`
